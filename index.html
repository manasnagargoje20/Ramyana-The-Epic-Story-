<p>The Ramayana is an ancient Sanskrit epic which follows Prince Rama's<br> quest to rescue his beloved wife Sita from the clutches of
     Ravana with the help<br> of an army of monkeys.... Comprising 24,000 verses in seven cantos, the epic<br> contains the teachings of the 
     very ancient Hindu sages. One of the most important<br> literary works of ancient India, it has greatly influenced art and culture in the 
     Indian<br> subcontinent and South East Asia, with versions of the story also appearing in the<br> Buddhist canon from a very early date. 
     The story of Rama has constantly been retold<br> in poetic and dramatic versions by some of India's greatest writers and also in narrative<br>
      sculptures on temple walls. It is one of the staples of later dramatic traditions, re-enacted<br> in dance-dramas, village theatre, 
      shadow-puppet theatre and the annual Ram-lila (Rama-play)<br>.he epic, traditionally ascribed to the Maharishi Valmiki, narrates the life
       of Rama, a<br> legendary prince of Ayodhya city in the kingdom of Kosala.<br> The epic follows his fourteen-year exile to the forest urged
        by his father King Dasharatha, <br>on the request of Rama's stepmother Kaikeyi; his travels across forests in the Indian subcontinent<br>
         with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, the kidnapping of<br> Sita by Ravana – the king of Lanka, that resulted in war; and 
         Rama's eventual return to Ayodhya <br>to be crowned king amidst jubilation and celebration. </p>
